## Educational Purpose Only

**This project is created solely for educational and learning purposes. It is NOT intended for production use or commercial deployment.**

### üéì Educational Scope

This Zoho Attendance Helper Extension serves as a:
- **Learning example** for browser extension development
- **Demonstration** of cross-browser compatibility techniques
- **Educational resource** for understanding web automation concepts
- **Code reference** for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS best practices
- **Tutorial project** for understanding browser APIs and extension manifests

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

#### **Do NOT use this in production environments because:**

1. **Security Concerns**
   - Extension has broad permissions that could be exploited
   - Automated clicking may bypass security measures
   - No comprehensive security auditing has been performed
   - May violate company security policies

2. **Legal & Policy Issues**
   - May violate your company's attendance policies
   - Could breach terms of service with Zoho People
   - Automated attendance manipulation may have legal implications
   - May violate employment agreements or regulations

3. **Reliability Issues**
   - Not tested across all Zoho People configurations
   - Web page changes can break functionality
   - No error recovery mechanisms for production use
   - Limited testing on different browser versions

4. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Automated attendance tracking may be considered dishonest
   - Could undermine trust between employer and employee
   - May give unfair advantage over colleagues
   - Contradicts the purpose of attendance tracking
